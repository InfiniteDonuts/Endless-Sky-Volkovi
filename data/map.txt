planet Kolia
	government Volkovi
	landscape land/water0
	description `Kolia is a prosperous colony world with a pleasant, temperate climate. Its main industry is farming, but there is a popular trade center and several mining settlements, also. It is a truly diverse world, with many species of native wildlife and plants, including fish, birds, and several kinds of insect-like mammals that are hunted for food.`
	spaceport `Kolia's spaceport is a raised stone platform located outside the planet's largest village; this is still a developing world. As you walk around the village, you come to the town square: it is a huge outdoor marketplace, selling everything from fresh meat to clothing to various handheld gadgets that only the Volkovi seem to understand how to use.`

planet Merin
	government Volkovi
	landscape land/sea10-sfiera
	description `Merin's surface is covered entirely in oceans, and it has a cool climate. All of the Volkovi cities on this planet are floating on the oceans or sometimes in the sky, and the view from their decks is truly stunning: the sea, stretching away into the distance, gives you the impression of infinity, and also makes you feel isolated.`
	spaceport `This city's spaceport bar has one wall open to the outside, letting the cool, salty sea breeze wash over you. You stare at it while you eat, fascinated by its size, which escapes your imagination even despite all your time spent in space.`

planet Rikha
	government Volkovi
	attributes urban
	landscape land/forest4
	description `Rikha is a wealthy and important Volkovi trade planet. Its surface is almost entirely forested, and the Volkovi do not wish to disturb this forest, so they build their cities up high in the mountains where the trees cannot grow. The weather is pleasant, with very little temperature variation from day to night, and it is almost always warm along the equator due to its lack of an axial tilt.`
	spaceport `Rikha's spaceport is huge, fancy, and generously decorated in a way that is appealing to the Volkovi. The restaraunts serve very fine food, and the hotel rooms are comfortable. Clearly, this is a very rich planet.`

planet Severni
	government Volkovi
	attributes farming
	landscape land/forest2
	description `Severni, which means "Northern" in the Volkovi language, is a pleasant, forested world with a temperate climate, friendly to warm-blooded beings such as humans, and the warm-blooded, doglike Volkovi. It is home to a wide array of wildlife such as native birds, fish, and giant six-legged insects that roam the forest floor.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is rather large in human terms, but for the advanced civilization of the Volkovi it is relatively small. Still, it is clean, and handles its many canine visitors with ease.`

planet Volkov
	government Volkovi
	attributes urban
	landscape land/fields8
	description `This is the homeworld of the Volkovi and thus their capital, where the doglike species rule their small empire. It is a beautiful grassland planet inhabited by large, gentle herbivore that the Volkovi hunt and eat. You see in the spaceport restaurant that it is a popular dish.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is massive, the size of a small town. From here, millions of Volkovi merchant captains, civilians, warriors, and government officials are hustling and bustling to buy and sell commodities, meet friends or family, receive orders, and the like.`
	spaceport `There are a lot of shops in the spaceport that sell various items, including meat, which seems to be the only thing they eat. Apparently, like dogs in human space, the Volkovi are carnivorous.`

planet "Volkovi Kari"
	government Quarg
	attributes quarg station
	landscape land/station2
	description `This is the Quarg ringworld that was built to observe the Volkovi species' evolution. Per the Quarg's stunning construction capabilities, the ringworld is massive; there are likely billions or even trillions of Quarg that live here. As you explore the station, you can see all the living quarters, shops, docking bays, and food-production facilities. The sheer size of the station staggers your senses.`
	spaceport `Most human stations barely have enough room for the biggest ships to dock. However, this Quarg ringworld tucks even the massive Volkovi battle dreadnaughts neatly into a corner of its hangar. Clearly, this station is beyond any construction capabilities of humans.`
	spaceport `    From what you have heard, the Volkovi are a proud and fearless warrior species. However, when you walk the hallways of this station, you can see various doglike aliens speaking with Quarg. You are not good at reading their canine faces, but from what you can tell, they seem to be subdued or scared: unlike any emotion you have ever seen them display. Clearly, the Volkovi are terrified of the Quarg for some reason.`
